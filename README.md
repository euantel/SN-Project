Code for MPhys Project 2024/25; finding 1e1gamma Bismuth-214 events for measuring radon activity. 

two main files: 

e_gamma.cpp - should be applicable to normal runs (UDD, tested on 1166), takes run number as argument
e_gamma_sim.cpp - for applying to simulation data to determine efficiency

may have issues with 2D vectors depending on machine
